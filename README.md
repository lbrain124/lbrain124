// My name is Lenae Brainard. I'm a Statistics major at the University of South Carolina - Upstate
// My graduation date is May 2022
// While I've briefly used GitHub for a C++ class in the past, I'm currently on here looking for data science projects
// I've used Java, C++, SAS, R, and all the MS stuff of course, but I actually have not used Python and Tableau,
// and I've been seeing those in a lot of job descriptions recently so I would like to gain some experience with those.
